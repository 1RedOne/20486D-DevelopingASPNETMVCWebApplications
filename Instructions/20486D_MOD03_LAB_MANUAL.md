    Basketball,
    Football,
    Soccer,
    Vollyball,
    Billiard,
    Hockey,
    Golf,
    Tennis
```

4. Create a new interface using the following information:
    - Parent folder: **Services**
    - Name: **IPollResultsService**

5. Add a method declaration inside the interface using the following information:
    - Return type: **void**
    - Name: **AddVote**
    - Parameter name: **game**
    - Parameter Type: **SelectedGame**

5. Add a method declaration inside the interface using the following information:
    - Name: **GetVoteResult**
    - Return type: **SortedDictionary**<**SelectedGame**,**int**>

6. Set **public** scope to the new interface.

####	Task 2: Define an implementation for the service

1. Create a class with the name **PollResultsService** inside the **Services** folder.

2. Create a new class by using the following information:
    - Parent folder: **Services**
    - Name: **PollResultsService**

3. Declare **IPollResultsService** interface, so that **PollResultsService** would be an implementation of **IPollResultsService**.

4. In the **PollResultsService** class, create a property that will contain the vote counts per game using the following information:
    - Scope: **private**
    - Type: **Dictionary**<**SelectedGame**,**int**>
    - Name: **SelectionVotes**
    - Access: **Read/Write**

5. Add a new constructor to the **PollResultsService** class. In the constructor, instantiate **SelectionVotes** to be a new **Dictionary**<**SelectedGame**,**int**> object.

6. Implement the **AddVote** method from the **IPollResultsService** interface. The method should increment the value of the dictionary's selected game, using the given game parameter value as it's key. In case the key does not exist, add a new key to the dictionary with the value of 1.

7. In the **PollResultsService** class, implement the **GetVoteResult** method from the **IPollResultsService** interface. The method should return a new **SortedDictionary** instantiated with **SelectionVotes** passed to its constructor.

####	Task 3: Use dependency injection

1. In the **Startup** class, Add **using** statements for the following namespaces:

    - Parameter type: **IHostingEnvironment**
    - Parameter name: **env**
    - Parameter type: **IPollResultsService**
    - Parameter name: **pollResults**

3. In the **Configure** method, replace the text that is printed from the **app.Run** to "This text was generated by the app.Run middleware. wwwroot folder path: ". Concatinate the string with a value from the **env.WebRootPath** property.

4. In the **app.Use**, between the initialization of the **selectedValue** variable and the **WriteAsync** method call, parse the **selectedValue** variable and return the result into the **selectedGame** variable using the following information:
    - Result variable type: **SelectedGame**
    - Result variable name: **selectedGame**
    - Method call: **Enum.Parse**
    - Enum type: **SelectedGame**
    - Variable name to parse: **selectedValue**
    - Ignore case sensitive: **true**

6. In the **app.Use**, below the initialization of the **selectedGame** variable, execute the **AddVote** method of the **IPollResultsService** service using the following information:
    - Parameter value: **selectedGame**

7. In the **app.Use**, below the call to **AddVote**, define a new variable using the following information:
    - Type: **SortedDictionary<SelectedGame, int>**
    - Name: **gameVotes**

8. In the **app.Use**, replace the **WriteAsync** method call with code that receives the result from the **GetVoteResult** method of the **lPollResultsService** service, and places it into the **gameVotes** variable.

9. In the **app.Use**, when the "favorite" query parameter exists, below the **GetVoteResult** method call, print to the browser each of the games names, and vote count from the **gameVotes** variable. Include the game name and votes of each iteration in a **DIV** element.

10. In the **Startup** class, in the **ConfigureServices**, add the poll results service using the following information: 
    - Add method: **Singleton**
    - Interface: **IPollResultsService**
    - Implementation: **PollResultsService**


####	Task 4: Run the application

1. Start debugging the **PollBall** application.

"This text was generated by the app.Run middleware. wwwroot folder path: [local path to your wwwroot folder]".

3. Access the following relative path:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

4. Select the **Basketball** radio button, and click the **Submit Form** button.

5. Verify that the browser displays the following text:<br>
"Game name: Basketball, Votes: 1"

6. Access the following relative path:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**
