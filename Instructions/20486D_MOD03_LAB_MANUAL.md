#### Scenario
The Adventure Works Company wants to develop a web site about ball games. For this, the company needs to perform a survey to determine the popularity of different ball games. As their employee you are required to create a survey site to be used by the company.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to: 

-	Use ASP.NET Core static files including HTML files, image files and CSS files.
-	Create and use a custom Middleware, and use its context information.
-	Create and use services with ASP.NET Core built-in Dependency Injection.
-	Inject a service to an ASP.NET Core MVC controller.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **75 minutes**

### Exercise 1: Working with Static Files

#### Scenario

To create the poll, the application needs a styled HTML page. The HTML page must then post the poll results to the server. To transfer the results to the server you will use an HTML form.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows: 

1.	Create a new project using the ASP.NET Core Empty project template.

2.	Run the application.

3.	Add an HTML file to the wwwroot folder.

4.	Run the application – content of HTML not displayed.

5.	Enable working with static files.

6.	Run the application – content of HTML is displayed.

7.	Add an HTML file outside of the wwwroot folder.

8.	Run the application – content of HTML outside wwwroot folder not displayed.

### Exercise 2: Creating Custom Middleware

#### Scenario

The server must receive the client’s request and notify the company for the poll submission.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows: 

1. Create a middleware.

2. Run the application.

3. Change the order of middleware.

####	Task 1: Create a middleware.

1. Create an **app.Use** custom middleware inside the **Configure** method, as the first middleware in the pipeline.

2. In the **app.Use**, write a code to check the existence of the "favorite" query parameter in the request, that submitted by the HTML form.

3. If the "favorite" query parameter does not exist in the request, invoke the next middleware in the pipeline.

4. If the "favorite" query parameter exists in the request, define a new variable using the following information:
    - Type: **string**
    - Name: **selectedValue**
    - Value: **"favorite" query parameter**

5. If the "favorite" query parameter exists in the request, print **Selected Value is = ** with the value of the ** selectedValue** variable to the browser using the **WriteAsync** method.

####	Task 2: Run the application.

1. Start debugging the **PollBall** application.

2. Access the following relative URL:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

3. Select the **Basketball** radio button, and click the **Submit Query** button.

4. Verify that the browser displays the text:<br>
"Selected Value is = Basketball"

5. Stop debugging. 

####	Task 3: Change the order of middleware.

1. Relocate the **app.UseStaticFiles** to be first middleware in the pipeline.

2. Start debugging the **PollBall** application.

3. Access the following relative URL:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

4. Select the **Basketball** radio button, and click the **Submit Query** button.

5. Verify that the browser displays the **poll-questions.html** file content, and not a different page.

6. Stop debugging. 

7. Move the **app.UseStaticFiles** between the **app.Use** middleware and the **app.Run**.

8. Comment out the code that present the case that the "favorite" query parameter does not exist.

9. Start debugging the **PollBall** application.

10. Access the following relative URL:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

11. Verify that the browser displays a blank page.

12. Stop debugging. 

13. Uncomment the code that present the case that the "favorite" query parameter does not exist.

>**Result**: At the end of this exercise, you will be able to create a custom middleware and receive HTML form calls to it.

### Exercise 3: Using Dependency Injection

#### Scenario

You will need to aggregate the votes and store them for future use. You will use services in order to manage and preserve the data.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows: 

1. Define an interface for a service.

2.	Define an implementation for the service.

3.	Use Dependency Injection.

4.	Run the application.

####	Task 1: Define an interface for a service.

1. Create a new top-level folder, in the **PollBall** project by using the following information:
    - Folder name: **Services**

2. Create a new ENUM by using the following information:
    - Name: **SelectedGame**
    - Parent folder: **Services**

3. Fill the enum with the following values:
```cs
    Basketball,
    Football,
    Soccer,
    Vollyball,
    Billiard,
    Hockey,
    Golf,
    Tennis
```

4. Create a new interface by using the following information:
    - Name: **IPollResultsService**
    - Parent folder: **Services**

5. Add a method declaration inside the interface using the following information:
    - Name: **AddVote**
    - Parameter name: **game**
    - Parameter Type: **SelectedGame**
    - Return type: **void**

5. Add a method declaration inside the interface using the following information:
    - Name: **GetVoteResult**
    - Return type: **SortedDictionary**<**SelectedGame**,**int**>

6. Set public scope to the new interface.

####	Task 2: Define an implementation for the service.

1. Create a class with the name **PollResultsService** inside the **Services** folder.

2. Ensure that the **PollResultsService** class implements the **IPollResultsService** interface.

3. Create a dictionary that will contain the vote counts per game using the following information:
    - Name: **SelectionVotes**
    - Return type: **Dictionary**<**SelectedGame**,**int**>
    - Scope: **private**
    - Access: **Read/Write**

4. Add a new constructor to the **PollResultsService** class. In the controller, instantiate **SelectionVotes** to be a new **Dictionary**<**SelectedGame**,**int**> object.

5. In the **PollResultsService** class, implement the **AddVote** method from the **IPollResultsService** interface. The method should increment the value of the dictionary's selected game, using the given game parameter value as it's key.

6. In the **PollResultsService** class, implement the **GetVoteResult** method from the **IPollResultsService** interface. The method should return a new SortedDictionary instantiated with **SelectionVotes** passed to its contructor.

####	Task 3: Use dependency injection.

1. In the **Startup** class, Add **using** statements for the following namespaces:
    - **PollBall.Services;**

2. Modify the **Configure** method so it will include the following injected services as parameters:
    - Parameter type: **lPollResultsService**
    - Parameter name: **app**
    - Parameter type: **IHostingEnvironment**
    - Parameter name: **env**
    - Parameter type: **IPollResultsService**
    - Parameter name: **pollResults**

3. In the **Configure** method, replace the text that is printed from the **app.Run ** to 
"This text was generated by the app.Run middleware. wwwroot folder path: ". Concatinate the string with a value from the **env.WebRootPath** property.

4. In the **app.Use**, when the "favorite" query parameter exists, define a new variable from its value and then parse it as an Enum using the following information:
    - Variable name: selectedGame
    - Method call: Enum.Parse
    - Enum type: SelectedGame 
    - Enum value: selectedValue
    - Ignore case sensitive: true 

6. In the **app.Use**, when the "favorite" query parameter exists, call the **AddVote** method of the **lPollResultsService** service using the following information:
    - Parameter value: **selectedGame**

7. In the **app.Use**, when the "favorite" query parameter exists, define a new variable using the following information:
    - Type: **SortedDictionary<SelectedGame, int>**
    - Name: **gameVotes**

8. In the **app.Use**, when the "favorite" query parameter exists, replace the **WriteAsync** method call with code that receives the **GetVoteResult** result from the **lPollResultsService** service, and places it into the **gameVotes** variable.

9. In the **app.Use**, when the "favorite" query parameter exists, below the **GetVoteResult** method call, print to the browser each of the games names, and vote count from the **gameVotes** variable.

10. In the **Startup** class, in the **ConfigureServices**, add the poll results service using the following information: 
    - Add method: **Singleton**
    - Interface: **lPollResultsService**
    - Implementation: **PollResultsService**


####	Task 4: Run the application.

1. Start debugging the **PollBall** application.

2. Verify that the browser displays the text:<br>
"This text was generated by the app.Run middleware. wwwroot folder path: [local path to your wwwroot folder]".

3. Access the following relative URL:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

4. Select the **Basketball** radio button, and click the **Submit Form** button.

5. Verify that the browser displays the text:<br>
**Game name: Basketball, Votes: 1**

6. Access the following relative URL:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

7. Select the **Football** radio button, and click the **Submit Form** button.

8. Verify that the browser displays the text:<br>
**Game name: Basketball, Votes: 1**<br>
**Game name: Football, Votes: 1**

10. Access the following relative URL:
    - Path: **/poll-questions.html**

11. Select the **Basketball** radio button, and click the **Submit Form** button.

12. Verify that the browser displays the text:<br>
**Game name: Basketball, Votes: 2**<br>
**Game name: Football, Votes: 1**

13. Stop debugging.

>**Result**: At the end of this exercise, you will be able to create and use a service with **Dependency Injection**.
